# Use Cases

`UC001` Overview of nodes: software version, sensors etc

`UC002` Overview of status of nodes: what is the battery level? has any node not sent messages for a while?

`UC002` Quantitative analyses, e.g. battery level over time, frequency of reports, etc., maybe using external service like Grafana

`UC003` Browse messages, detect any odd behavior of nodes

`UC004` Database maintenance: delete obsolete information

# Requirements

## MQTT

- [x] `R001` capture all MQTT messages from MySensors nodes, store in database

- [x] `R012` capture time & date when message was received

- [ ] `R013` capture which gateway received the message

### Nodes
